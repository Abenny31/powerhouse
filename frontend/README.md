# PowerHouse Frontend

This is a small React app replacing the original Razor views. Run `npm install` and `npm run build` to produce static files in `build/` which can be copied to `PowerHouse/wwwroot` for deployment.

The generated `index.html` in `wwwroot` is intentionally minimal. Insert links to
your preferred CSS framework or custom styles in its `<head>` section to apply
colors and design.
